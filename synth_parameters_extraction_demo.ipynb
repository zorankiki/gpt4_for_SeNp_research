       "'Production and purification of bio-synthesized elemental selenium nanoparticles (BioSeNPs). A 1% Comamonas testosteroni S44 inoculum was incubated in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL Luria-Bertani (LB, Difco) broth and cultured for 12 h (up to the middle of exponential growth), then 10 mM sodium selenite was added and incubation continued at 28 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for 3 days. The production of elemental selenium was confirmed by the appearance of red color. The culture was collected by centrifugation (Eppendorf 12492) for 10 min at 8,000 rpm. Cells were lysed by sonication after washing twice by double distilled water (ddH2O, 18.25 MΩ·cm). Following centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D) at 12,000 rpm for 5 min and removing the supernatant, the pellets were then resuspended in ddH2O and centrifuged twice with 80% (w/v) sucrose for 30 min to remove biomass (Fig.\\xa0S1). The pure BioSeNPs on the bottom were collected after washing twice by ddH2O and temporarily preserving in −20 °C.\\nProduction of selenium nanoparticles (CheBioSeNPs) by L-reduced glutathione (GSH). The production of CheBioSeNPs followed the protocol developed by Jain et al.26 with minor modifications. A 1% inoculum of C. testosteroni S44 was inoculated in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL LB broth and cultured for 3.5 days. Cells were collected by centrifugation (Eppendorf 5810 R, 8,000 rpm, 4 °C) and washed twice\\nFigure 7. Schematic model for the molecular mechanism of BioSeNPs formation in bacteria. The majority of biosynthesized elemental selenium nanoparticles (BioSeNPs) are formed closing to the proximity of the cell border due to the demand of selenite reductase accepting electron from electron donors within the inner membrane. A little selenite is reduced by glutathione and thus BioSeNPs may appear in center of cells. During the total process of BioSeNP formation and stabilization in bacterial cells, proteins enriched in charged amino acids are the major factors, carbohydrates and lipids are the minor factors.\\n9SCienTifiC REPORTS | (2018) 8:4766 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-23295-5\\nwith ddH2O. Then, bacterial cultures were concentrated in 20 mL ddH2O and lysed by French pressure, the supernatant of lysed cellular fractions (SLCF) was collected after centrifugation (Eppendorf 5810 R, 8,000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min). CheBioSeNPs were generated by adding 200 µL 1 M sodium selenite and 0.25 g GSH into the SLCF at room temperature. Pure CheBioSeNPs were collected by centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D, 12,000 rpm, 15 min) after washing twice by ddH2O.\\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Dispersion X-ray Detector (EDX) analyses. C. testosteroni S44 was cultured in LB broth for 3 days with the addition of 10 mM sodium selenite. Collected cells were centrifuged (Eppendorf 5810 R) at 4,000 rpm and washed twice by 0.85% sodium chloride solution. The cells were immobilized with 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight and then rinsed three times in 0.15 M sodium cacodylated buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h. The specimens were dehydrated in graded series of ethanol (15, 30, 50, 75, 95 and 100%) and embedded in Epon for preparation of sections. The sections were collected on copper grids with Formvar supporting membranes. Images were obtained with Hitachi H-7650 (Japan) after staining with uranyl acetate. The ultrathin sections for TEM and EDX were obtained by a cryosection system (UC6, Leica, Germany).\\nThe Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), zeta potential and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis of SeNPs. BioSeNPs and CheBioSeNPs were suspended in ddH2O. Absorbance was measured using a visible light spectrophotometer at wavelengths between 350 to 900 nm. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analyses were performed using Mastersizer 2000 (UK). The lyophilized BioSeNPs, CheBioSeNPs and SLCF from C. testosteroni S44 were prepared for fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis. The sample was mixed with spectroscopic grade potassium bromide (KBr, dried for 24 h at 60 °C) in a ratio of 1:100 and the spectrum recorded in the range of 400–4000 wavenumber (cm−1) on the FT-IR spectrometer, Spectrum 100 (Perkin Elmer, USA) in the diffuse reflectance mode at a resolution of 4 cm−1 in KBr pellets.\\nQuantification of Se and chemical composition of coated agents on BioSeNPs. The Se concentration was determined by the method of Keka et al.52. The carbohydrates were determined as described Jain et al.26 with minor modifications. Purified BioSeNPs were suspended in ddH2O and sonicated for 30 min, then held in a boiling water bath for 10 min to release as many carbohydrates as possible. The supernatant was used for quantification of carbohydrates53 after centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D, 12,000 rpm, 5 min). Protein quantification was performed using the Lowry assay54. BioSeNPs were suspended in 10% SDS solution and held in a boiling water bath for 20 min to strip the binding proteins. The supernatant was used for protein quantification after centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D, 12,000 rpm, 5 min). Lipid extraction and determination of BioSeNPs were used the method described by Drenovsky et al.55.\\nProteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and proteomics. Binding proteins striped from BioSeNPs and CheBioSeNPs were used the method described by Dobias et al.30 with minor modifications. Pure SeNPs was mixed in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution and held in a boiling water bath for 20 min to separate the binding proteins. The stripping proteins were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) techniques56. The proteins from gel were purified and digested based on the protocol described by Katayama et al.57, digested peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatograph-mass separation-mass spectra (LC-MS-MS, by Sangon, Shanghai, China). Protein identification was performed by searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database (NCBInr) using the Mascot Program (http:// www.matrixscience.com).'"
