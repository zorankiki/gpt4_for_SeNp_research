Polyurethane (PU) foam was used as a template to fabricate scaffolds by the foam replica method. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was used for the preparation of PLGA/SeNp microspheres. SeNp were synthesized by dissolving ascorbic acid in distilled water and adding sodium selenite to the solution, followed by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to stabilize the particles. PLGA/SeNp microspheres were then produced using a physicochemical solvent/nonsolvent method.

      "SeNPs were synthesized by a chemical reduction approach. The experiments were planned by DOE methodology, and parameters were optimized concerning the high SeNPs yielding percent and without compromising the particle size, morphology, and amorphous nature. Three different formulations were obtained by combining different stabilizing and reducing agents: (i) SeNPs stabilized with BSA (SeNPs-BSA); (ii) SeNPs stabilized with chitosan (SeNPs-Chit); and (iii) SeNPs synthesized only by reduction with glucose (SeNPs-Gluc). Sodium selenite was used as a precursor for all samples. The SeNPs-BSA and SeNPs-Chit were obtained by reduction with ascorbic acid. Briefly, sodium selenite was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 0.02 M (12.5 mL). In separate flasks, 0.125 M solutions of ascorbic acid were prepared (10 mL). These solutions were then mixed with solutions of chitosan or BSA (5 mL at a concentration of 0.87% w/w). In the final step, the prepared solution of sodium selenite was added dropwise. Reaction mixtures were stirred on a magnetic stirrer (1,500 rpm) until their colors changed to red-orange. The mass ratio between sodium selenite and chitosan or BSA was adjusted to 1:1. For the third formulation (SeNPs-Gluc), glucose was firstly dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 0.055 M (25 mL). This solution was then placed on a magnetic stirrer, heated up to 130◦C, and stirred at 1,500 rpm. The 0.017 M solution of sodium selenite (10 mL) was introduced drop by drop immediately after heating started. After ∼1 h, the solution became orange/reddish, as a sign of complete reduction and conversion to Se0 nanoparticles. During the preparation of all samples, reaction vessels were covered with aluminum foil to prevent photo-oxidation and crystallization of obtained SeNPs. After preparation, colloidal solutions of SeNPs were stocked at 4–8◦C. For FTIR and XRD measurements, samples were lyophilized in an alpha 1-4 LD freeze dryer (Martin Christ) at 0.36 mbar.\n",

After completion of the refluxing process, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the solution obtained was kept in dark to prevent photo-oxidation. This sodium selenosulphate solution (0.25 M), containing unreacted Na2SO3, was used as a stock for Se precursor. 1% PVA stock solution was prepared by the addition of 1.0 g of PVA into 100 ml water, while stirring at 80 °C.

The formation of selenium nanoparticles was studied for different time periods, depending on the nature and the concentration of the monomer used. Completion of the reaction, during the study of the reaction kinetics, was checked by spectrophotometric method as well as by the addition of dilute nitric acid in a small volume of the reaction mixture, after separating the selenium nanoparticles, using high-speed centrifuge (acid test). The presence of unreacted sodium selenosulphate was indicated by almost instantaneous development of red colour due to the acid-induced formation of selenium nanoparticles.\n",

      "In an attempt to synthesize polymer–selenium nanoparticle composites by radiation-induced method, it was observed that sodium selenosulphate reacts with vinyl monomers, precipitating elemental selenium, under ambient conditions. The simplicity and environmentally friendly nature of the reaction drove us to study it in detail, and to develop it as a new method for the production of selenium nanoparticles. A detailed study of the reaction was first carried out with acrylamide monomer, in the presence of PVA stabilizer, to produce selenium nanoparticles. Then, it was extended to other vinyl monomers, such as sodium acrylate, N,N0-dimethylene bis acrylamide, methyl methacrylate, α-methyl styrene, etc. PVA was found to be an efficient stabilizer for selenium, as its presence in the reaction mixture resulted in the formation of orange/red colored selenium nanoparticle sols, while in its absence, black elemental selenium powder precipitated out from the reaction mixture. Kinetics of the formation reaction and particle size of synthesized selenium nanoparticles, by the reaction of sodium selenosulphate with different monomers, have been investigated. The intensity of the selenium nanoparticle sols was found to be dependent on the concentration of sodium selenosulphate taken in the reaction mixture. A typical selenium nanoparticle sol formed by the reaction of 1.0*10^3 mol dm^-3 sodium selenosulphate with 1.6*10^2 mol dm^-3 acrylamide, in the presence of 0.05% PVA is shown in Fig. 1. Selenium nanoparticles are known to exhibit a regular absorption maximum, in the wavelength region above 350 nm, only when particle size is 150 nm, or more. Both the absorption maximum and the peak intensity are reported to change with the particle size. The absorption maximum generally shifts towards red, and the peak intensity decreases with an increase in the size of the nanoparticles. Fig. 2 shows the effect of the concentration of the selenium precursor as well as that of PVA on the UV–vis optical absorption spectra of selenium nanoparticle sols (recorded at 24 h of the reaction time), prepared by the reaction of sodium selenosulphate with acrylamide monomer. It is observed that with an increase in the sodium selenosulphate concentration from 0.5*10^3 to 1.5*10^3 mol dm^-3, the absorption maximum shifts to higher wavelengths, whereas the intensity of the absorption band first decreases, and then increases. The presence of an additional absorption band, with a maximum at 570 nm, in the sol formed at the highest studied concentration of sodium selenosulphate, may be due to the formation of two types of selenium nanoparticles. The observed increased intensity of this sol may be due to the contribution from these smaller selenium nanoparticles, which are expected to have a higher extinction coefficient. However, when the concentration of the PVA stabilizer is varied from 0.05% to 0.15%, at fixed concentrations of sodium selenosulphate and acrylamide monomer, an increase in the intensity of the absorption peak, along with a blue shift in its absorption maximum, is observed, suggesting a decrease in the particle size. The observed spectral shifts match well with that reported earlier, due to a decrease in the particle size. Thus, it is clear from Fig. 2 that, with an increase in the concentration of the selenium precursor, the size of the nanoparticles increases, whereas the increase in the concentration of PVA stabilizer results in smaller-sized selenium nanoparticles. Fig. 3a and b show the absorption spectra of the selenium sols, at different times, formed by the reaction of sodium selenosulphate (1.5*10^3 mol dm^-3) with BisAM and NaA monomer (9.0*10^2 mol dm^-3), respectively, in the presence of 0.05% PVA. There is a gradual red shift in the absorption maximum with the reaction time, in the case of both the monomers, indicating the growth of the nanoparticles. The absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture did not show any change in the studied wavelength region up to about initial 45 min (in the case of BisAM) and 60 min (in the case of NaA) of reaction time, both in air and nitrogen-saturated solutions. Probably, the changes might be taking place in the lower wavelength region. The nature of the absorption spectrum of the selenium sol was also found to depend on the functional group present in the monomer used. The absorption spectra of selenium sols formed by the reaction of sodium selenosulphate with the different studied monomers are shown in Fig. 4. These selenium sols have absorption maxima values of 330, 528, 558, 574, and 560 nm for acrylonitrile, N,N0-dimethylene bis acrylamide, sodium acrylate, acrylamide, and methyl methacrylate monomers, respectively, indicating an increase in the average size of the selenium nanoparticles in the same order. The lower value of the absorption maximum, in the case of methyl methacrylate, is due to only 40% completion of the reaction. X-ray diffraction technique was used to determine the crystal structure of selenium nanoparticles. The typical XRD patterns of the synthesized sample, after heat treatment at 130 8C for 30 min, and that of the commercially available selenium, are displayed. The XRD pattern of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles, without heat treatment, was much noisier, with broader peaks, indicating the nano-crystalline nature of the particles. All the diffraction pattern peaks could be indexed according to the trigonal phase, with lattice constants a = 4.366 Å and c = 4.956 Å, which match very well with the reported values. Further, the chemical composition of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles was confirmed by EDAX. The EDAX spectrum of the nanoparticles also indicates that the nanoparticles are of pure selenium only, and no other element is present therein. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles and standard commercial selenium sample were recorded from 50 to 250 8C. DSC thermogram of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles showed an exothermic transition at 85 8C, along with an endothermic melting peak at 217 8C. The enthalpy of the transition was found to be 21.83 J/g. The repeat DSC thermogram of the same selenium sample, recorded after bringing it to the ambient temperature, did not show any exothermic peak at the mentioned temperature. This observation indicates that the selenium particles lose their nano-crystalline nature in the first thermal run itself, and the transition could be assigned to an increase in the crystallinity of the selenium nanoparticles. This observation is in corroboration with the XRD results obtained with the synthesized sample and that annealed at 130 8C. DSC thermogram of the standard selenium powder sample, depicting a melting peak 217 8C, without any such exothermic peak, is shown. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques were used to investigate the morphology and structure of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles. The typical 2D and 3D AFM images of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles are shown. The 2D image of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles shows that the average size of the selenium nanoparticles, or that of their aggregates, is about 100 nm, while the 3D image indicates the presence of individual spherical particles, with a maximum height of 8 nm in the z-direction. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope images of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles are shown, demonstrating the spherical shape of the individual nanoparticles and narrow size distribution. The conclusion drawn from AFM, SEM, and TEM studies are more or less in corroboration with each other. The present method is capable of producing spherical selenium nanoparticles, and the size of the particles (100–200 nm) and kinetics of the formation process depend on the nature and concentration of the monomer used. The rate of formation of selenium nanoparticles was found to be dependent on the nature as well as the concentration of the vinyl monomer used in the reaction. When the reaction was carried out at a higher concentration of the monomers, selenium was released for 30 min. The kinetics of the reaction was studied with acrylamide, sodium acrylate, BisAM, and methyl methacrylate monomers. The reaction with acrylic acid monomer was not studied, as the presence of –COOH group leads to acid-induced selenium formation, in addition to that due to the carbon–carbon double bond present in it. In a typical solution, containing 9.0*10^2 mol dm^-3 acrylamide, 1.5*10^3 mol dm^-3 sodium selenosulphate, and 0.05% PVA, appearance of the selenium nanoparticles was observed in 85 min, and the reaction was completed in 6 h. The presence of sodium selenosulphate was confirmed to be absent by the acid test. The rate of the reaction of sodium selenosulphate with different monomers, in decreasing order, was found to be AN > BisAM > NaA > AM > MMA, where AN refers to acrylonitrile, BisAM refers to N,N0-dimethylene bis acrylamide, NaA refers to sodium acrylate, AM refers to acrylamide, and MMA refers to methyl methacrylate. The observed reactivity can be correlated with the presence of different functional groups in the monomers. The formation of selenium nanoparticles was also observed with α-methyl styrene monomer, but the rate was much slower. This is because of limited solubility of α-methyl styrene in aqueous medium as well as due to the presence of an electron-donating methyl group on the carbon–carbon double bond. Thus, we can say that, ‘‘the higher is the electron-withdrawing capacity of the substituent at the carbon–carbon double bond of the vinyl monomers, the faster is the reaction, or vice versa’’.\n",

      "In comparison to microbial agents, the utilization of plant extracts in green synthesis has gained popularity due to its eco-friendliness, use of biodegradable reducing agents, and cost reduction. In this study, tea protein was obtained from tea leaves using an alkaline extraction-acid precipitation method. TP extract with a content of 28.12% was obtained by hydrolyzing tea protein at pH 6, temperature 50°C, for 3 h, with a concentration of 4% papain. TP-SeNPs with a minimum particle size of 98 nm were biologically synthesized by adding 3% TP at pH 4 and a reaction temperature of 55°C for 6 h. TP-SeNPs exhibited absorption peaks of SeNPs at 285 nm in the UV spectrum, and the presence of selenium was confirmed by the peak at 1.37 keV in EDS, along with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, originating from tea peptides bound to the surface of selenium nanoparticles. Electron microscopy showed a thin layer coating on the surface of TP-SeNPs, indicating the stabilizing effect of TP, ensuring the stability and preventing aggregation of the nanoparticles. Infrared spectroscopy revealed changes in C=O, NH, and C-N, suggesting that TP’s stabilization of SeNPs may involve physical adsorption, covalent interactions, and other unknown interactions, preventing the aggregation or degradation of the complex. XRD analysis demonstrated the crystalline structure of TP-SeNPs, indicating a transition from amorphous to crystalline structure, which may enhance the material properties and improve the antioxidant and antibacterial abilities of TP-SeNPs. Over a period of 7 days at 25°C and 4°C, the absorbance ratio of the peptide-nano selenium colloid solution remained stable. TP-SeNPs exhibited higher antioxidant activity than SeNPs at high concentrations, and 10% TP-SeNPs showed good antibacterial activity. This study presents a novel and innovative approach to synthesizing SeNPs using plant-derived polypeptides, with potential applications in various fields, including the food and pharmaceutical industries. Further research is needed to evaluate the biocompatibility and safety of TP-SeNPs, including cytotoxicity and biocompatibility tests. Additionally, determining the optimal size range for the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of TP-SeNPs requires further investigation.\n",

      "Synthesis of selenium nanoparticles. SeNPs were prepared via a reduction of sodium selenite by ascorbic acid and stabilized by polysorbate 20. Briefly, 30 mg of Na2SeO3.5H2O was added to 90 mL of Milli-Q water. Ascorbic acid (10 mL, 56.7 mM) was added dropwise to sodium selenite solution with vigorous stirring.10 µL of polysorbate were added after each 2 ml of ascorbic acid. Selenium nanoparticles were formed after the addition of ascorbic acid. This can be visualized by a color change of the reactant solution from clear white to clear red. All solutions were made in a sterile environment by using a sterile cabinet and double distilled water. Selenium nanoparticles were then collected by centrifuging the solution at 12000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in sterile double distilled water before use in bacteria experiments. Selenium contents of nanoparticles were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, model Vista-Pro from Varian). \n",

In detail, to 0.1 mol L−1 solution of Na2SeO3, Cys solution (50 × 10−3 mol L−1) was added dropwise with vigorous stirring (stirring speed of 1000 rpm) for 60 min. In parallel, SeNPs were obtained using PVA as a stabilizing agent. In each method of synthesis, the final concentration of selenium was equal to 1 × 10−3 mol L−1, and the reductants were equal to 4 × 10−3 mol L−1. After the synthesis, SeNPs were purified from the surrounding liquid containing dissolved substrate residuals using different procedures: (i) centrifugation for 10 min with two units of rotational speed 8000 rpm (3122 rcf) and 12,000 rpm (17,257 rcf), decantation and rinsing three times with 10 mL of deionized water; (ii) additional heating with magnetic stirring at 70 °C for 1 h, then rinsing three times with 10 mL of deionized water.
